Users subscribe to vendors or products, and OpenCVE alerts them when a new CVE is created or when an update is done in an existing CVE. You can manually install OpenCVE, or use docker . We also provide a running instance on https://www.opencve.io if you don't want to host it yourself. How it Works OpenCVE uses the JSON feed provided by the NVD to update the local list of CVEs. After an initial import, a background task is regularly executed to synchronize the local copy with the NVD feed. If a new CVE is added, or if a change is detected, the subscribers of the related vendors and products are alerted. Info Read the dedicated documentation to learn in details how OpenCVE works. Requirements OpenCVE works with Python >=3.6 . It uses the JSONB feature for performance, so you will need a PostgreSQL instance to store the data (CVE, Users, Vendors, Products, Subscriptions, ...). Other engines are not supported. The pg_trgm module of PostgreSQL is required to let you search in the CVEs list. The upgrade-db command will enable it for you, but you can also do it yourself if you prefer ( CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm ). Celery is used to periodically fetch the NVD database and update the list of CVEs. For that you will need a broker: you can use the backend you want but we recommend you Redis for the ease of installation. In any case OpenCVE requires a Redis instance to store a lock, if you choose this backend all the Celery requirements will be filled with one dependency. During the import of initial data OpenCVE will download and parse huge files, like the CPE dictionnary. For that we recommend you 3.5G RAM at least. Installation We provide 2 methods to install OpenCVE : manual installation docker installation The second method can be useful if you don't want to manage the dependencies (like PostgreSQL, Redis or Celery).

Info For now the only method of notification is the mail, but we work to add other integrations (webhooks, Slack, Jira, PagerDuty, OpsGenie...). Source of Data The first step, if you want to install OpenCVE, is to import the whole list of CVEs, CPEs and CWEs into a local PostgreSQL database. This is the job of the import-data command.

After this process the local PostgreSQL instance is now populated, and OpenCVE can already be used to search and list CVEs, or filter them by CWE or Vendors/Products. Events and Changes New CVEs appear every day, so OpenCVE must synchronize the local database to reflect the changes. A periodic task is scheduled every 15 minutes to check the new changes: First the meta file is downloaded to compare the sha256 value with the last known in the database Then, if this checksum has changed, OpenCVE downloads the CVE-Modified file and check each CVE in it. Info The code of this process can be found here . For each CVE the lastModifiedDate field is compared with the value in the local database. If the date is not the same, it means something has changed: maybe it's the summary of the CVE, maybe a reference has been updated, maybe a CPE has been added, maybe its CVSS score changed, etc. To find what has really changed, OpenCVE executes a list of checks (the code is here ). Then it creates one or more events . And because a CVE can have multiple events in the same batch, these events are grouped into changes . The following events are supported: Type Triggered when new_cve A new CVE is created references The references list changes cpes The CPE list changes cvss The CVSSv2 or CVSSv3 scores change summary The summary changes cwes The CWE list changes For instance the CVE-2021-44228 has been modified the 20 Dec 2021: During this change, 2 events have been created ( cpes and references ): Finally the change is displayed in the homepage to the end user: Note Of course an alert is also sent to the users who suscribed to one or more vendors/products of this CVE.

You can list the last CVEs per vendor, filter them by CVSS or analyse the changes in your reports. All the following endpoints are available under https://example.com/api . We also provide a running instance of OpenCVE, in this case the API can be found on https://www.opencve.io/api . Warning The OpenCVE API is still in Beta , some changes may appear until the stable version. Authentication We only support basic authentication for now, but we plan to add other ones like token based authentication. To use the Basic Authentication with the OpenCVE API, simply pass your credentials in the Authorization header. Most clients do it for you, for example using curl : curl -u username:password https://www.opencve.io/api/cve You can omit your password, curl will interactively ask you. Pagination Some endpoints can return lots of results (get the list of CVEs, the list of vendors, the list of reports, etc). In these cases the request must be paginated with the ?page parameter. Example with the list of CVEs: curl https://www.opencve.io/api/cve?page=100 When no result is found (the page parameter is too high), a 404 HTTP status code is returned.
